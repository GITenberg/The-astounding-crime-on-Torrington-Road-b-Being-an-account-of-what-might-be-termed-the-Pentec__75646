summary: '"The Astounding Crime on Torrington Road" by William Gillette is a narrative
  likely written in the early 20th century. This intriguing account appears to delve
  into a gripping criminal case, centering around characters involved in a complex
  plot, including a staff reporter, Horace McClintock, and potential suspects like
  Hugo Pentecost and Stephen W. Harker. The story seems to promise a blend of investigation
  and drama, inviting readers into a world of audacity and deception.  The opening
  of the narrative introduces us to Horace McClintock, a New York reporter who is
  dispatched to Boston, where he coincidentally meets Andrew H. Barnes, a man connected
  to a mysterious case involving a young man named Jamie Dreek. As McClintock narrates
  his earlier experiences trailing Dreek during a train ride, we learn about ominous
  events tied to the houses located on Torrington Road. Barnes, meanwhile, has been
  observing this case for two years, compellingly hinting at its intricate nature
  as he seeks a reporter to help transcribe his findings about the strange occurrences
  linked to the Haworth family and a historic mansion. The tension mounts as McClintock
  weighs the ethical implications of involving himself in this sensational account.
